optga is a multi-objective optimization framework for machine learning models.

    *This dataset has three obejctive variables; Y1, Y2, and Y3.
    Fortunately, they are well predicted by machine learing model.*

    *Then, how can we optimize these objective variables simultaneously?*

OverView
========

optga explores experimental condition to optimize multiple objective variables in trade-off relationship, using genetic algorithm.

optga enables

* Rapid optimization
* Easy user interface

by limitating the target to machine learning models,

Install
=======

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install optga


Getting started
===============

Single objective optimization example of wine dataset.


.. code-block:: python

    import os
    print("hello world")
