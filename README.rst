Optiga
======

Optiga is a multi-objective optimization framework for machine learning models.

    *This dataset has three obejctive variables Y1, Y2, and Y3. They are well predicted by machine learing model.*

    *Then, how can we optimize these objective variables simultaneously?*


OverView
========

Using genetic algorithms, Optiga explores experimental condition to optimize multiple objective variables in trade-off relationship.

By limiting the target to machine learning models, optiga enables rapid optimization and simple user interface.
